## Features

### As a Smart Contract Owner
For the first time use, the Smart Contract Owner should `initialize` the Smart Contract for global account allocation.
- `initProject`

The smart contract owner can only withdraw SOL from this PDA
- `withdraw`
 
### As a player(Summary of Game Logic)
Players can play this game.

If the player set the number 1-3 and deposit 0.1 SOL, then call function `play_game`, the program generate the random number and compare with the set number. 

If the random number is in [1, 3], then he will win and call function `claim_reward` to receive the reward. The reward amount is double of deposit amount.

If the random number isn't in [1, 3], then he will lose.
